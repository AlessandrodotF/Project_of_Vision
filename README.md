# Using image segmentation to find mountain peaks
The classification of geological features of landscapes is
essential for geomorphological mapping and for a broad
spectrum of disciplines. For a long time this was a te-
dious job. Thanks to the birth of automated computational
analysis of height maps that has changed. A part of this
change has come thanks to the advent of artificial intelli-
gence. In the following project we will describe the imple-
mentation and training of the convolutional neural Network
UNet. Starting from high-quality data examples we will try
to build an autonomous summit recognition algorithm and
we will explore qualitatively its performance. More details in Real_Report_vision.pdf
